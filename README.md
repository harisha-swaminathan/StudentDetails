Project description:

In part 1, data is fetched from the given api and presented on the screen.
In part 2, the data presented on the screen is styled.
In part 3, a search bar is created. The data presented below is filtered by the name entered in the search bar.
In part 4, the student list is styled as an expandable list. On expanding each student's data, a detailed list of their test scores is displayed.
In part 5, the expanded list also shows a new input field to add tags to a student. All tags that are added to a student are displayed below the test score in the expanded view. A new search bar is now available to filter students by tags. 
If a name and a tag is entered in the two search bars respectively, only students with the entered name who contain the entered tag will be displayed.
